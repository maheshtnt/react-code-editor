# Getting Started with Create React App

A new react app can be created by making use of react-create-app command in the terminal/command prompt.

# Importing The App

To import the app, simply download the files from this repository and place them in the folder containing the files created by react-create-app command.
If prompted to replace the files in the destination with the new files, click yes and continue.

# Running The App

In order to run the app, cd to the directory containing the app and run the command "npm start". This runs a predefined command specified in the "start" property of the package's "scripts" object, which is a file in the directory created initially in the first step.

# Accessing The App

The app, once run through the above command, can be viewed by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your browser. This is due to the app running on the port 3000 by default, which can be changed according to requirement.
